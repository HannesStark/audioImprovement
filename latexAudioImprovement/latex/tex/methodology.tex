\section{Introduction}

A paper that offers an overview of the supervised separation of speech from background noise \parencite{2017-speech-seperation-overview}.



Speech Enhancement GAN (SEGAN) \parencite{2017-SEGAN} is probably a good approach.

Hamburg university released a video
\hyperlink{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1fcvTzhKvY}{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1fcvTzhKvY}
where they show off their DNN speech Enhancement
which has a paper \parencite{2019-Noise-reduction-hamburg} associated to it.


\subsection{Loss Functions}

MSE makes little sense since a shift in phase should not be regarded as difference. A better idea may be 
differentiable dynamic time warping distance \parencite{2017-wasserstein-gan}, or earth mover's distance 
\parencite{2017-loss-function-for-time-series} according to \textcite{2019-deep-learning-audio-processing}.
